#FEATURES

In order to maintain a competitive pool and interest in bidding on auctions, so the sellers can be not afraid of selling an item for a lower price using auction iCancel changesnstead of a default listing a user can only list an item on auction once every 12 hours.

To prevent people from abusing the platform by repetitively cancelling auctions a blacklist feature was added which bans a user from listing again after cancelling 2 times.
